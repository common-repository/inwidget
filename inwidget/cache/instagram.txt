But the day before he passed away unexpectedly, he finally allowed Nina to photograph him. This motivated Nina to pursue work that challenges her viewers to shift their visual concepts and narratives. She says, \u201cIf we\u2019re not challenging ourselves, we\u2019re not living, we\u2019re not growing.\u201d\nNina is one of this year\u2019s recipients of the Getty Images (@gettyimages) Instagram Grant.
